As this is such a broad topic, there are no strict guidelines, just go through documentation to see how methods work and what they expect.

This section of the codebase might be less documented and more messy, I apologise in advance.

These PRs will also take a lot longer to be reviewed, and integrated into the codebase.

Finally, please feel free to reach out to me for any questions either at Twitter [CryogenicPlanet](https://twitter.com/CryogenicPlanet) or by emailing me hello [at] modfy.video
