        </h3>
        <p>
          {'>'} A Browser Based Video Transcoder is a fancy way of saying that
          we process video/audio on your browser. To elaborate, we are not
          processing these video files in a server like conventional video tools
          on the internet;rather, we are using your own computer and browser to
          process these files.{' '}

      <div className="how">
        <h3 className="sub-title">$ How is this different to other tools?</h3>
        <p>
          {'>'} The main difference is that your video file never leaves your
          computer, all the processing is completely done on your system. This
          is possible as a result of{' '}

          , which allows us to recompile desktop tools to work within the
          browser(this is an over simplification). Specifically, we are using{' '}

        <h3 className="sub-title">$ Why is this tool important? </h3>
        <p>
          {'>'} We think this tool is important, because we think your privacy
          is important. While most video processing sites claim to protect your
          privacy there is no way to know for sure, but our tool has no server
          and is completely open-source. So you do not have to take our word but
          can check for yourself.

            CLUI

          design, which allows the community to add workflows and features on
          their own, which allows users to complete complex tasks with a single
          click.

        <h3 className="sub-title">$ What can it do?</h3>
        <p>
          {'>'} Our goal with this project is to be able to do everything FFmpeg
          can do and more, but as the project is in its early stages the number
          of supported features are limited but ever growing. A full list of
          features is available{' '}

            in our docs!

          But you can always just explore features on the CLUI and find them.
